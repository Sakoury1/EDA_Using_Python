# Data Cleaning, Analysis & Visualization Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project presents a complete data analysis pipeline, starting from raw data preprocessing to actionable insights and interactive dashboards. The main objective is to ensure high data quality before analysis and to present results in a clear, interactive, and decision-oriented manner.

The project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing**, including handling missing values, detecting and treating outliers, and resolving data inconsistencies and errors. After preprocessing, an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, followed by effective data visualization.

An **interactive dashboard** was developed both within a Jupyter Notebook for exploration and as a **standalone Streamlit web application** for user-friendly interaction.
